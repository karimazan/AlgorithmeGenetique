# Genetic Algorithm - Optimization Project

This academic project implements a **genetic algorithm** to maximize the following objective function:
\[ f(x) = -x^2 + 4x \]
within the range [1, 30]. The algorithm explores various solutions through selection, crossover, and mutation processes to reach an optimal solution.

## Project Objective

The goal is to use a genetic algorithm to maximize the function \( f(x) \) and evaluate the impact of different genetic parameters (crossover probability, mutation probability, and the number of generations) on the optimization efficiency.

## Methodology

1. **Initial Population:**  
   - The population is composed of 4 individuals (chromosomes).
   - Each individual is encoded on 5 bits (genes).

2. **Crossover:**  
   - Crossover is performed using the **uniform crossover method**.
   - New solutions generated by crossover and mutation are selected based on their fitness improvement.

3. **Mutation:**  
   - Mutations are applied with a scenario-specific probability.

4. **Selection:**  
   - The best current solutions are selected to form the new generation.

5. **Scenarios:**  
   - Four scenarios were experimented with, each having different parameters:
     - Crossover probability (Pc)
     - Mutation probability (Pm)
     - Maximum number of generations (max-generation)

## Experimental Parameters

- **Number of individuals:** 4
- **Number of bits (genes) per individual:** 5
- **Optimization range:** [1, 30]
- **Variable parameters across scenarios:**
  - Crossover probability (Pc)
  - Mutation probability (Pm)
  - Maximum number of generations (max-generation)

## Collected Statistics

For each scenario, the following statistics are collected:
- **Execution time** of the algorithm
- **Fitness vector** (fitness for each individual across generations)
- **Average and maximum fitness**
- **Number of crossovers and mutations** performed

## Results

The results are analyzed through:
- **Comparative charts** of the four experimental scenarios
- The impact of genetic parameters (Pc, Pm, max-generation) on fitness maximization
- The effect of crossovers and mutations on the performance of generated solutions

## Conclusion

Analyzing the results helps better understand the influence of crossover and mutation probabilities and the maximum number of generations on the efficiency of the genetic algorithm in this optimization context.
